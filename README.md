# VS Code Snazz Theme

A VS Code theme based on [vscode-snazzy-operator](https://github.com/aaronthomas/vscode-snazzy-operator) and optimised for use with the [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview/) font.

Tweaks to the colouring will lean somewhere between Snazzy and [Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com/visual-studio-code/). I test this theme everyday in few Languages; Javascript (ES5 / ES6), JSON, CSS, SCSS, MD, Bash & Dockerfile. Feel free to raise any issues on github.

## Installation

The theme is available on the [VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mattconde.vscode-snazz-theme) and can be installed in VS Code via Quick Open (⌘P) by running:

```
ext install vscode-snazz-theme
```

Alternatively it can be found using the Extensions search feature (⇧⌘X).
